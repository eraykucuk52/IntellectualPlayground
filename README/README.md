### About Bagels
Bagels is a fun and challenging number puzzle game, the first in our IntellectualPlayground series. In this game, players attempt to guess a secret number based on feedback from their guesses.

### How to Play
- The game chooses a secret three-digit number.
- Players make guesses, and the game provides clues:
  - **Fermi:** A digit is correct and in the right position.
  - **Pico:** A digit is correct but in the wrong position.
  - **Bagels:** No digit is correct.
- The goal is to guess the number in the fewest tries possible.

## 2.Birthday Paradox
This repository contains a Python program that simulates the Birthday Paradox. The Birthday Paradox explores the counterintuitive probability that, in a set of randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday.

### About Birthday Paradox
The Birthday Paradox isn't a true paradox, but a statistical phenomenon that explains how within a group of 23 people there's a 50% chance that two people will share the same birthday. As the group size increases, the probability grows and surprisingly quickly surpasses 99%.

### How to Use

To run the Birthday Paradox simulation:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using Python.
