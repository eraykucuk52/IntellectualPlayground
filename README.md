### About Bagels
Bagels is a fun and challenging number puzzle game, the first in our IntellectualPlayground series. In this game, players attempt to guess a secret number based on feedback from their guesses.

### How to Play
- The game chooses a secret three-digit number.
- Players make guesses, and the game provides clues:
  - **Fermi:** A digit is correct and in the right position.
  - **Pico:** A digit is correct but in the wrong position.
  - **Bagels:** No digit is correct.
- The goal is to guess the number in the fewest tries possible.

## 2.Birthday Paradox
![Birthday Paradox](https://github.com/eraykucuk52/IntellectualPlayground/blob/main/birthdayParadox/birthdayParadox.jpg?raw=true)
This repository contains a Python program that simulates the Birthday Paradox. The Birthday Paradox explores the counterintuitive probability that, in a set of randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday.

### About Birthday Paradox
The Birthday Paradox isn't a true paradox, but a statistical phenomenon that explains how within a group of 23 people there's a 50% chance that two people will share the same birthday. As the group size increases, the probability grows and surprisingly quickly surpasses 99%.

### How to Use

To run the Birthday Paradox simulation:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using Python.

## Installation and Running the Program
To install and run the program, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/eraykucuk52/IntellectualPlayground.git
1. If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from python.org.
2. In the terminal, navigate to the cloned directory:
cd birthday-paradox-simulation
3. Run the program:
python birthday_paradox.py

The simulation will output the probability of two individuals sharing a birthday in a specified number of random people.

## 3.Bitmap Message 

### About Bitmap Message
This program uses a multiline string as a bitmap, a 2D image with only two 
possible colors for each pixel, to determine how it should display a message 
from the user. In this bitmap, space characters represent an empty space, and 
all other characters  are replaced by characters in the user’s message. The 
provided bitmap resembles a world map, but you can change this to any image 
you’d like. The binary simplicity of the space-ormessage-characters system 
makes it good for beginners. Try experimenting with different messages to see 
what the results look like!
